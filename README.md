Restaurant Rating Microservices
This Git repository contains three microservices - usermicroservice, ratingmicroservice, and hotelmicroservice - designed to work together to provide a comprehensive restaurant rating system. This system allows users to rate and review restaurants, aggregating those ratings to calculate an overall rating for each restaurant. Here, we'll discuss each of these microservices and their advantages.

Advantages
User Microservice
The usermicroservice is responsible for user management within the restaurant rating system. It provides the following functionalities:

User registration and authentication.
User profile management.
Authorization control for user actions (e.g., allowing users to rate restaurants).
Rating Microservice
The ratingmicroservice is the core component responsible for collecting and processing restaurant ratings and reviews. Its features include:

User-initiated restaurant ratings and reviews.
Calculating and updating restaurant average ratings based on user inputs.
Retrieving restaurant ratings and reviews.
Hotel Microservice
The hotelmicroservice focuses on restaurant management and information. It provides:

Restaurant creation and management.
Storing restaurant details, including name, location, cuisine, and contact information.
Retrieving restaurant details.
Advantages
By splitting the restaurant rating system into three distinct microservices, we gain several advantages:

Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently, allowing us to handle increased load in a more fine-grained manner. This means we can allocate more resources to the ratingmicroservice during peak rating periods without affecting the other services.

Modularity: The system is more modular and easier to maintain. Changes and updates can be made to individual services without affecting the entire system.

Faster Development: Different teams can work on each microservice simultaneously, enabling faster development and feature implementation.

Improved Performance: Microservices are designed for specific purposes, leading to improved performance. The ratingmicroservice, for instance, can focus solely on processing ratings, making it highly efficient.

Fault Isolation: If one microservice fails, it doesn't necessarily bring down the entire system. This provides a level of fault isolation and robustness.

Flexibility: You can choose different technologies, languages, or databases for each microservice, providing flexibility in technology selection based on the specific requirements of each service.

Easier Testing: Microservices are smaller and easier to test in isolation, making it simpler to ensure the correctness and reliability of the system.

Getting Started
If you want to set up this system locally or deploy it, please refer to the README files in each of the microservice directories (usermicroservice, ratingmicroservice, hotelmicroservice) for detailed instructions on installation, configuration, and usage.

Please follow the READMEs within each microservice for further information.

This README provides an overview of the three microservices and highlights their advantages when used together to create a restaurant rating system. For detailed information about each microservice, please refer to their respective directories and README files in this repository.
