Introduction
Modern restaurant rating systems are essential for helping users make informed choices when dining out. This project's microservices aim to provide an advanced and user-friendly restaurant rating platform. Users can rate restaurants, leave reviews, and view ratings to make informed decisions.

Microservices
User Microservice
Responsible for user management and authentication.
Allows users to create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
Ensures the security and privacy of user data.
Rating Microservice
Manages restaurant ratings and reviews.
Allows users to rate restaurants and leave detailed reviews.
Aggregates ratings and reviews to provide restaurant ratings.
Provides data for restaurant recommendations.
Hotel Microservice
Manages restaurant details and information.
Provides data on restaurants, including location, cuisine, and operating hours.
Integrates with external services for additional restaurant data.
Advantages
By breaking the restaurant rating system into microservices, several advantages are gained:

Scalability: Each microservice can be scaled independently, ensuring that the system can handle increased load during peak times.

Modularity: Microservices are self-contained, making it easier to develop, test, and deploy changes without affecting the entire system.

Fault Isolation: Issues in one microservice are less likely to impact the entire system, improving fault tolerance.

Improved Developer Productivity: Smaller, more focused codebases are easier to work with and maintain.

Flexibility: Microservices allow for the use of different technologies, databases, and deployment strategies for each service, tailored to their specific requirements.

Getting Started

Set up and run each microservice by following their individual setup instructions.

Configure the microservices to work together. Ensure they can communicate and share data effectively.

Usage
Detailed usage instructions for each microservice are available in their respective directories.
Refer to the documentation and API endpoints for interaction with the services.
